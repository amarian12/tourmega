                Verified Guides and Operators
              %p TourMega requires tour guides and operators submit to a verification process prior to posting on the platform. Verifications include the following: government ID, text, and social media verifications such as Linkedin, Facebook and Twitter.

                Peer Reviews
              %p Peer reviews are an important tool that allow travelers to provide an honest assessment of the tour guides and experiences. After each tour or activity, travelers are given the option to rank their experience and provide both public and private feedback. Both types of feedback are used to ensure the experiences meet the high standards TourMega expects and will be used to determine which tours and activities are allowed on the platform.
