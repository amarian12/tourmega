          The Federal Republic of Brazil (Brazil) is home to approximately 204 million people which makes it the most populated country in Latin America and the second most populated in the Western Hemisphere, behind the United States. Brazil is also a very large country from a land area perspective with a land area just smaller than the US. Given its size, Brazil borders 10 different countries which is rather unique and reflects the scale and diversity of the country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you want to learn to make caipirinhas while overlooking the beach, dance samba with locals, or explore the Amazon alongside the many indigenous peoples that call it home, Brazil has got you covered.  It is a very large and vibrant country with so much to offer. Start planning your trip today and don’t hesitate to contact the guides or TourMega with questions.

        </p>

        <p>
          With its size and deep history China offers travelers tremendous opportunities to experience modern China while staying in one of its megacities or a much more rural and traditional way of life, especially in central and eastern china. Get out and experience the country and interact with the people and culture that will continue to shape the world for years to come.

          The Republic of Costa Rica (Costa Rica) is pretty much a tropical paradise. With two different bodies of water bordering the eastern and western portions of the country, it is quite possible for someone to watch the sunrise over the Caribbean Sea and watch it set over the Pacific Ocean, all in the same day.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it’s not just beaches that makes Costa Rica a desirable location, the small Central American country provides visitors with access to lush rainforests and magnificent volcanoes. It’s biodiversity is considered to be among the richest in the world and the people among the most welcoming. With a population of only 4.8 million, it is small country with a lot to explore and a lot to offer every type of traveler.

        <p>
          The Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt) is arguably the oldest nation state with a deep history that spans millennia. Known by many as the “cradle of civilization,” ancient Egypt played a central role in developing modern writing, governance, and urban planning, among other things. Home to approximately 82 million, the country is largely desert and would not be habitable if not for the water provided by the storied Nile River.
        </p>

        <p>
          Millions of travelers go to Egypt to walk where pharaohs walked, see their remains, and take in some of the oldest structures built by modern man. Yet, just when you think you’ve seen it all, a new layer is peeled back, ancient story retold, or famous recipe reworked to adapt to modern tastes. That is the story of Egypt, constantly changing yet remaining what it is at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now is an especially unique time to visit Egypt. While issues throughout North Africa and the Middle East have caused tourism to decline, the sites are there for your to explore and the people ever welcoming and eager to show you what real Egyptian life was and is. Search through TourMega for verified guides and activities to help you experience Egypt and all its wonders.

        <p>
          The Republic of India (India) has witnessed significant growth over the past 30 to 40 years, much of this driven by a young and very large population (approximately 1.2 billion people). Given that India is roughly a third the size of the US in terms of land area yet has a population over three times its size, India is an extremely dense country which offers travelers a truly unique and unforgettable experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the population density, India is a very large country with many less populated regions where one can take in a slower pace of life or see wildlife in their natural habitats if that is what you’re looking for. Don’t let the size and congestion intimidate you, there is so much for you to explore in India. TourMega guides can be especially helpful for those looking to navigate this dense, complex, and wonderful country.

          The Italian Republic is home to 61 million people spread across the boot shaped country and islands. One does not have to look far to see the influence ancient or modern Italy has had on our world today and so being able to be a part of the land that was and is the source for that influence is truly an amazing experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          While seeing the sites as they stand today is truly a treat, it’s also the people that make the Italian experience what it is. Exuding a passion for life, the streets of Rome or Florence or Milan are filled with an energy that one has to experience first hand to truly appreciate.
        </p>

        <p>
          We could write countless paragraphs more on the country, but why? Get out there and experience the glory of ancient and modern Italy.
